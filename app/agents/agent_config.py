# Define agent configurations here. Each agent selects a subset of tools
# by name and can have a distinct system prompt. Add more agents as needed.
#
# Prompt variables (handled by agent handlers via build_agent(prompt_vars=...)):
# - Common: {doc_file} â€” if set by the handler, indicates the selected/active file for this session.
#   Add new variables by referencing them in the agent's `system_prompt` and supplying them
#   from the corresponding handler.
