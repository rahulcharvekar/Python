# Define agent configurations here. Each agent selects a subset of tools
# by name and can have a distinct system prompt. Add more agents as needed.
#
# Prompt variables (handled by agent handlers via build_agent(prompt_vars=...)):
# - MyProfile: {profile_file} — injected by the MyProfile handler from settings.MYPROFILE_FILE.
#             {profile_name} — best-effort name extracted from the profile file.
#   Add new variables by referencing them in the agent's `system_prompt` and supplying them
#   from the corresponding handler.
